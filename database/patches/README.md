# Database Patch Directory
Place database patches in this directory and add a corresponding file, `../../version/install/manifest` that includes the patch ID and full patch name:
```
33457235 p33457235_1913000DBRU_Linux-x86-64.zip
```
When applying multiple patches, add the entries in order of application.

There is no need to add OPatch to this list; it is checked automatically.
